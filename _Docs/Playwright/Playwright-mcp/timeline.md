## Release Pattern Analysis
The project shows a very rapid release cycle, often multiple versions per week or even per day (e.g., April 1st, April 14th). This suggests an active "move fast and fix things" approach, likely iterating on the MCP protocol integration and Playwright compatibility.

> **Note**: The version numbers jump from `v0.0.28` (May) to `v0.0.52` (Dec). There is a gap in the fetched log, or development slowed down/stabilized between May and December.
